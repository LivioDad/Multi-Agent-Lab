# MQTT Sensor Network – Multi-Agent System

## Overview
This repository contains a set of exercises implementing a MQTT-based sensor network
using a multi-agent architecture.
The project progressively extends a basic sensor network with aggregation,
dynamic behavior and anomaly detection.

Each exercise is located in its own directory and documented with a dedicated README.md.

## Repository Structure
